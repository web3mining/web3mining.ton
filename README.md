# How it works?

## Web3Mining VS traditional mining

We compared the payback of WhatsMiner M50 118 TH/s and our Web3Mining NFT with a similar price. The profitability of a digital miner is higher. There are 3 reasons for this:

1. The best electricity price you can imagine. Only $0.088 for 1kWh.(https://farms.emcd.io/ 4.9rub)
2. First class service. By purchasing Web3Mining NFT, you do not need to maintain your fleet of devices yourself.
3. System of discounts.

With Web3Mining NFT mining is available to everyone. You will never buy a real miner for 100 TON, but our digital miners cost exactly that much and generate income after purchase.

| Traditional mining |            | Web3Mining NFT |              |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| ROI                | 9.7%/year  | ROI            | 28.62% /year |
| Electricity        | 0.088$/kWh | Electricity    | 0.082$/kWh   |
| maintenance        | 2$/day     | maintenance    | 0$/day       |

# What are you getting?

1. Digital miner 1/9 of the cost of physical equipment
2. Weekly payouts in TON to your wallet
3. Choosing an NFT in terms of power and energy efficiency

# Selection of NFT miners

NFT miners differ from each other in terms of power and energy efficiency.

### Energy efficiency

This is the amount of energy required to mine 1 TH. The lower it is, the more efficient the miner and the lower the electricity fee.

| Cooling type | Power |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Air          | 50 Wh |
| Immersion    | 35 Wh |
| Water        | 25 Wh |

# How it works?

1. Web3Mining is real BTC mining, where you choose the power and energy efficiency of the equipment.
2. You do not need to worry about choosing a supplier, delivery and connection of equipment, its expensive maintenance and energy costs.

## Profitable mining starts immediately after buying NFT

- The cost of electricity in our data centers is below market
- We provide discounts for paying for equipment, increasing the amount of remuneration
- mining in a pool can bring much more BTC than alone

## Mine and get TON

Once you have purchased an NFT, you become part of the mining world and can decide how to grow your business. We suggest you do this in a game format where you can choose from (n) scenarios:

### 1. SBT Mining NFT

Solo Mining is owned by NFT. The first reward in TON will go to your wallet next week, after buying NFT.

### 2. Pool Mining NFTs

Pool mining game. First you need to join a pool or create your own.

You are pooling the processing power of multiple Workers. This mining increases the chances of winning and the size of your reward.

In case of victory, the creator of the pool receives 1% of the total pool reward, all other participants receive TON in proportion to their activity in the game and power.

## Reward distribution principles

Mining Reward = PI - ((F1+F2)\*(1-Σd))-(F3+F4)

> The accrual is awarded only if MR>0.

- PI - Pool Income - amount of BTC accrued by the pool at a rate of 1 TH a day (Rewards type: fpps - minus fee)
- Σd
- F1 - costs per 1 TH a day
- F2 - service and infrastructure costs at a rate of 1 TH a day.
- F3 - contribution to the insurance pool calculated at 2% of the pool accrual amount at a rate of 1 TH a day.
- F4 - management costs calculated at 8% of the pool accrual amount at a rate of 1 TH a day.
