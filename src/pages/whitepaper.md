## Introduction

### What is Web3 Mining?

Web3Mining is the first example of a "Non-Fungible Token" backed by real Worker power. Itâ€™s an inspiration for the [TEP-62](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md) standard that powers Web3, Workers and bitcoin mining.

## General Principles

Built For Miners by Miners

Web3Mining is a DAO with a mission to simplify the intricate world of crypto mining. We have been in the industry since 2014, working on the full cycle of BTC mining. Our skill sets include:

1. Construction of data centers.
2. Production of modular prefabricated buildings to accommodate equipment.
3. Production of our own automatically controlled service centers.
4. Development of a unique monitoring system to provide 99.8% uptime.
5. Testing and implementation of different firmware, and successful testing of different temperature regimes and equipment placement formats.

We decided to offer the community a universal and convenient product suitable for both professional market players and crypto enthusiasts: we have created a unique NFT collection Workers, backed by the real computing power of our device fleet.
