# Energy efficiency

The value of NFTs is based not only on their Workers power in TH, but also on their energy efficiency in W/TH.

> Energy efficiency is the rational use of energy to provide a specified level of computing power.
>
> More energy-efficient mining decreases the overall level of energy consumption and, as a result, reduces the negative impact of mining on the environment.

Our NFT miners, like real ones, use energy when mining. This is because the mining process takes place in a real blockchain network. That's why you pay electricity fees when you receive NFT rewards.

On our NFT Collection you can choose from NFT miners with different energy efficiencies:

- Air Cooling — 50 W/TH

All current miners have this energy efficiency.

- Hydro Cooling — 25 W/TH

These are the most energy-efficient miners in our NFT collection, your electricity fees will be the lowest.

### Energy efficiency VS Electricity fee (F1)

The lower the W/TH of the NFT, the lower the F1 electricity fee, that's deducted from your rewards. And so the net reward is higher.
The cost of electricity is variable and depends on various factors. For calculations, we always take the average electricity cost for the project over the billing period. It ranges from from $0.045 to $0.07 per 1 kW.

For example, the cost of electricity is $0.045 and your NFT is 8 TH. Then the electricity fee per day is:

> - (50 W/TH _ 8 TH)/1000 _ $0.045 = $0.018 — for NFT with energy efficiency 50 W/TH
> - (25 W/TH _ 8 TH)/1000 _ $0.045 = $0.009 — for NFT with energy efficiency 25 W/TH

Since the electricity is paid in USD and accruals from the pool are made in BTC, we recalculate the cost of electricity weekly at the TON rate at the time of payment.
