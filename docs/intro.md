# О Web3Mining

## Цели проекта

Мы создали простой способ добычи BTC, который не требует от вас покупки дорогостоящего оборудования и погружения в тонкости настройки и подключения вашего оборудования. Коллекции Web3mining помогут вам преодолеть основные барьеры и облегчат вам начало майнинга.

## What network did we issue NFTs

All NFTs from Web3Mining collections are issued on the TON blockchain using the [TEP-62](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md) standard. In the future, our project team may issue NFTs on other networks as well, so stay tuned!

## What are the unique features of these N

NFTs from the W3M collections are backed by the real constantly growing computing power of our data centers. By purchasing them, you take ownership of a portion of that computing power, which is already engaged in mining Bitcoin. More info on these NFTs you can find in our Whitepaper.

For holding NFTs from our collection, you will receive week mining rewards proportional to the amount of your mining power. Each NFT has a series attached to it that refers to the amount of computing power — U1/U2/U3/U6/U9 etc

What's more, our NFTs are crypto works of art that can be sold on any public marketplace.

The rarity of each NFEach NFT of W3M collections has XX various parameters, each one coming in different variants. They are:

- Pool
