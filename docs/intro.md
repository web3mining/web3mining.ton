# About W3M

## Goals

W3M helps you mine BTC without having to buy expensive equipment or having to figure out how to set it up and connect it. NFT collections will make it easier for you to get started with mining.

### What network did we issue NFTs

All NFTs from Web3Mining collections are issued on the TON blockchain using the [TEP-62](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0062-nft-standard.md) standard. In the future, our project team may issue NFTs on other networks as well, so stay tuned!

Our NFT are stored in collection

### What are the unique features of these NFT

NFTs from the W3M collections are backed by the real constantly growing computing power of our data centers. By purchasing them, you take ownership of a portion of that computing power, which is already engaged in mining Bitcoin. More info on these NFTs you can find in our Whitepaper.

For holding NFTs from our collection, you will receive week mining rewards proportional to the amount of your mining power. Each NFT has a series attached to it that refers to the amount of computing power â€” U1/U2/U3/U6/U9 etc

What's more, our NFTs are crypto works of art that can be sold on any public marketplace.

### What are the rarity values for NFTs from W3M collection?

The rarity of each NFEach NFT of W3M collections has XX various parameters, each one coming in different variants. They are:

- Pool
- Hashrate
- Power Ratio
- Power On Wall
- Energy Efficiency

There is no strict mathematical ratio to the rarity values. Information about the rarity of each modification can be found on [getgems](https://telegra.ph/What-is-Rarity-and-how-it-works-06-20)
